# NAGIOS.CFG - Sample Main Config File for Nagios 4.4.6
#
# Read the documentation for more information on this configuration
# file.  I've provided some comments here, but things may not be so
# clear without further explanation.
#
#
##############################################################################


# LOG FILE
# This is the main log file where service and host events are logged
# for historical purposes.  This should be the first option specified
# in the config file!!!

log_file=/usr/local/nagios/var/nagios.log



# OBJECT CONFIGURATION FILE(S)
# These are the object configuration files in which you define hosts,
# host groups, contacts, contact groups, services, etc.
# You can split your object definitions across several config files
# if you wish (as shown below), or keep them all in a single config file.

# You can specify individual object config files as shown below:
cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/commands.cfg
cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg
cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/timeperiods.cfg
cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/templates.cfg

# Definitions for monitoring the local (Linux) host
cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/localhost.cfg

# Definitions for monitoring a Windows machine
#cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/windows.cfg

# Definitions for monitoring a router/switch
#cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/switch.cfg

# Definitions for monitoring a network printer
#cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/printer.cfg


# You can also tell Nagios to process all config files (with a .cfg
# extension) in a particular directory by using the cfg_dir
# directive as shown below:

#cfg_dir=/usr/local/nagios/etc/servers
#cfg_dir=/usr/local/nagios/etc/printers
#cfg_dir=/usr/local/nagios/etc/switches
#cfg_dir=/usr/local/nagios/etc/routers




# OBJECT CACHE FILE
# This option determines where object definitions are cached when
# Nagios starts/restarts.  The CGIs read object definitions from
# this cache file (rather than looking at the object config files
# directly) in order to prevent inconsistencies that can occur
# when the config files are modified after Nagios starts.

object_cache_file=/usr/local/nagios/var/objects.cache



# PRE-CACHED OBJECT FILE
# This options determines the location of the precached object file.
# If you run Nagios with the -p command line option, it will preprocess
# your object configuration file(s) and write the cached config to this
# file.  You can then start Nagios with the -u option to have it read
# object definitions from this precached file, rather than the standard
# object configuration files (see the cfg_file and cfg_dir options above).
# Using a precached object file can speed up the time needed to (re)start
# the Nagios process if you've got a large and/or complex configuration.
# Read the documentation section on optimizing Nagios to find our more
# about how this feature works.

precached_object_file=/usr/local/nagios/var/objects.precache



# RESOURCE FILE
# This is an optional resource file that contains $USERx$ macro
# definitions. Multiple resource files can be specified by using
# multiple resource_file definitions.  The CGIs will not attempt to
# read the contents of resource files, so information that is
# considered to be sensitive (usernames, passwords, etc) can be
# defined as macros in this file and restrictive permissions (600)
# can be placed on this file.

resource_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/resource.cfg



# STATUS FILE
# This is where the current status of all monitored services and
# hosts is stored.  Its contents are read and processed by the CGIs.
# The contents of the status file are deleted every time Nagios
#  restarts.

status_file=/usr/local/nagios/var/status.dat



# STATUS FILE UPDATE INTERVAL
# This option determines the frequency (in seconds) that
# Nagios will periodically dump program, host, and
# service status data.

status_update_interval=10



# NAGIOS USER
# This determines the effective user that Nagios should run as.
# You can either supply a username or a UID.

nagios_user=nagios



# NAGIOS GROUP
# This determines the effective group that Nagios should run as.
# You can either supply a group name or a GID.

nagios_group=nagios



# EXTERNAL COMMAND OPTION
# This option allows you to specify whether or not Nagios should check
# for external commands (in the command file defined below). 
# By default Nagios will check for external commands.
# If you want to be able to use the CGI command interface
# you will have to enable this.
# Values: 0 = disable commands, 1 = enable commands

check_external_commands=1



# EXTERNAL COMMAND FILE
# This is the file that Nagios checks for external command requests.
# It is also where the command CGI will write commands that are submitted
# by users, so it must be writeable by the user that the web server
# is running as (usually 'nobody').  Permissions should be set at the
# directory level instead of on the file, as the file is deleted every
# time its contents are processed.

command_file=/usr/local/nagios/var/rw/nagios.cmd



# QUERY HANDLER INTERFACE
# This is the socket that is created for the Query Handler interface

#query_socket=/usr/local/nagios/var/rw/nagios.qh



# LOCK FILE
# This is the lockfile that Nagios will use to store its PID number
# in when it is running in daemon mode.

lock_file=/run/nagios.lock



# TEMP FILE
# This is a temporary file that is used as scratch space when Nagios
# updates the status log, cleans the comment file, etc.  This file
# is created, used, and deleted throughout the time that Nagios is
# running.

temp_file=/usr/local/nagios/var/nagios.tmp



# TEMP PATH
# This is path where Nagios can create temp files for service and
# host check results, etc.

temp_path=/tmp



# EVENT BROKER OPTIONS
# Controls what (if any) data gets sent to the event broker.
# Values:  0      = Broker nothing
#         -1      = Broker everything
#         <other> = See documentation

event_broker_options=-1



# EVENT BROKER MODULE(S)
# This directive is used to specify an event broker module that should
# by loaded by Nagios at startup.  Use multiple directives if you want
# to load more than one module.  Arguments that should be passed to
# the module at startup are separated from the module path by a space.
#
#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING
#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#
# Do NOT overwrite modules while they are being used by Nagios or Nagios
# will crash in a fiery display of SEGFAULT glory.  This is a bug/limitation
# either in dlopen(), the kernel, and/or the filesystem.  And maybe Nagios...
#
# The correct/safe way of updating a module is by using one of these methods:
#    1. Shutdown Nagios, replace the module file, restart Nagios
#    2. Delete the original module file, move the new module file into place,
#	restart Nagios
#
# Example:
#
#   broker_module=<modulepath> [moduleargs]

#broker_module=/somewhere/module1.o
#broker_module=/somewhere/module2.o arg1 arg2=3 debug=0



# LOG ROTATION METHOD
# This is the log rotation method that Nagios should use to rotate
# the main log file. Values are as follows..
#	n	= None - don't rotate the log
#	h	= Hourly rotation (top of the hour)
#	d	= Daily rotation (midnight every day)
#	w	= Weekly rotation (midnight on Saturday evening)
#	m	= Monthly rotation (midnight last day of month)

log_rotation_method=d



# LOG ARCHIVE PATH
# This is the directory where archived (rotated) log files should be
# placed (assuming you've chosen to do log rotation).

log_archive_path=/usr/local/nagios/var/archives



# LOGGING OPTIONS
# If you want messages logged to the syslog facility, as well as the
# Nagios log file set this option to 1.  If not, set it to 0.

use_syslog=1



# NOTIFICATION LOGGING OPTION
# If you don't want notifications to be logged, set this value to 0.
# If notifications should be logged, set the value to 1.

log_notifications=1



# SERVICE RETRY LOGGING OPTION
# If you don't want service check retries to be logged, set this value
# to 0.  If retries should be logged, set the value to 1.

log_service_retries=1



# HOST RETRY LOGGING OPTION
# If you don't want host check retries to be logged, set this value to
# 0.  If retries should be logged, set the value to 1.

log_host_retries=1



# EVENT HANDLER LOGGING OPTION
# If you don't want host and service event handlers to be logged, set
# this value to 0.  If event handlers should be logged, set the value
# to 1.

log_event_handlers=1



# INITIAL STATES LOGGING OPTION
# If you want Nagios to log all initial host and service states to
# the main log file (the first time the service or host is checked)
# you can enable this option by setting this value to 1.  If you
# are not using an external application that does long term state
# statistics reporting, you do not need to enable this option.  In
# this case, set the value to 0.

log_initial_states=0



# CURRENT STATES LOGGING OPTION
# If you don't want Nagios to log all current host and service states
# after log has been rotated to the main log file, you can disable this
# option by setting this value to 0. Default value is 1.

log_current_states=1



# EXTERNAL COMMANDS LOGGING OPTION
# If you don't want Nagios to log external commands, set this value
# to 0.  If external commands should be logged, set this value to 1.
# Note: This option does not include logging of passive service
# checks - see the option below for controlling whether or not
# passive checks are logged.

log_external_commands=1



# PASSIVE CHECKS LOGGING OPTION
# If you don't want Nagios to log passive host and service checks, set
# this value to 0.  If passive checks should be logged, set
# this value to 1.

log_passive_checks=1



# GLOBAL HOST AND SERVICE EVENT HANDLERS
# These options allow you to specify a host and service event handler
# command that is to be run for every host or service state change.
# The global event handler is executed immediately prior to the event
# handler that you have optionally specified in each host or
# service definition. The command argument is the short name of a
# command definition that you define in your host configuration file.
# Read the HTML docs for more information.

#global_host_event_handler=somecommand
#global_service_event_handler=somecommand



# SERVICE INTER-CHECK DELAY METHOD
# This is the method that Nagios should use when initially
# "spreading out" service checks when it starts monitoring.  The
# default is to use smart delay calculation, which will try to
# space all service checks out evenly to minimize CPU load.
# Using the dumb setting will cause all checks to be scheduled
# at the same time (with no delay between them)!  This is not a
# good thing for production, but is useful when testing the
# parallelization functionality.
#	n	= None - don't use any delay between checks
#	d	= Use a "dumb" delay of 1 second between checks
#	s	= Use "smart" inter-check delay calculation
#       x.xx    = Use an inter-check delay of x.xx seconds

service_inter_check_delay_method=s



# MAXIMUM SERVICE CHECK SPREAD
# This variable determines the timeframe (in minutes) from the
# program start time that an initial check of all services should
# be completed.  Default is 30 minutes.

max_service_check_spread=30



# SERVICE CHECK INTERLEAVE FACTOR
# This variable determines how service checks are interleaved.
# Interleaving the service checks allows for a more even
# distribution of service checks and reduced load on remote
# hosts.  Setting this value to 1 is equivalent to how versions
# of Nagios previous to 0.0.5 did service checks.  Set this
# value to s (smart) for automatic calculation of the interleave
# factor unless you have a specific reason to change it.
#       s       = Use "smart" interleave factor calculation
#       x       = Use an interleave factor of x, where x is a
#                 number greater than or equal to 1.

service_interleave_factor=s



# HOST INTER-CHECK DELAY METHOD
# This is the method that Nagios should use when initially
# "spreading out" host checks when it starts monitoring.  The
# default is to use smart delay calculation, which will try to
# space all host checks out evenly to minimize CPU load.
# Using the dumb setting will cause all checks to be scheduled

# program start time that an initial check of all hosts should
# be completed.  Default is 30 minutes.

max_host_check_spread=30



# MAXIMUM CONCURRENT SERVICE CHECKS
# This option allows you to specify the maximum number of
# service checks that can be run in parallel at any given time.
# Specifying a value of 1 for this variable essentially prevents
# any service checks from being parallelized.  A value of 0
# will not restrict the number of concurrent checks that are
# being executed.

max_concurrent_checks=0



# HOST AND SERVICE CHECK REAPER FREQUENCY
# This is the frequency (in seconds!) that Nagios will process
# the results of host and service checks.

check_result_reaper_frequency=10




# MAX CHECK RESULT REAPER TIME
# This is the max amount of time (in seconds) that  a single
# check result reaper event will be allowed to run before
# returning control back to Nagios so it can perform other
# duties.

max_check_result_reaper_time=30




# CHECK RESULT PATH
# This is directory where Nagios stores the results of host and
# service checks that have not yet been processed.
#
# Note: Make sure that only one instance of Nagios has access
# to this directory!

check_result_path=/usr/local/nagios/var/spool/checkresults




# MAX CHECK RESULT FILE AGE
# This option determines the maximum age (in seconds) which check
# result files are considered to be valid.  Files older than this
# threshold will be mercilessly deleted without further processing.

max_check_result_file_age=3600




# CACHED HOST CHECK HORIZON
# This option determines the maximum amount of time (in seconds)
# that the state of a previous host check is considered current.
# Cached host states (from host checks that were performed more
# recently that the timeframe specified by this value) can immensely
# improve performance in regards to the host check logic.
# Too high of a value for this option may result in inaccurate host
# states being used by Nagios, while a lower value may result in a
# performance hit for host checks.  Use a value of 0 to disable host
# check caching.

cached_host_check_horizon=15



# CACHED SERVICE CHECK HORIZON
# This option determines the maximum amount of time (in seconds)
# that the state of a previous service check is considered current.
# Cached service states (from service checks that were performed more
# recently that the timeframe specified by this value) can immensely
# improve performance in regards to predictive dependency checks.
# Use a value of 0 to disable service check caching.

cached_service_check_horizon=15



# ENABLE PREDICTIVE HOST DEPENDENCY CHECKS
# This option determines whether or not Nagios will attempt to execute
# checks of hosts when it predicts that future dependency logic test
# may be needed.  These predictive checks can help ensure that your
# host dependency logic works well.
# Values:
#  0 = Disable predictive checks
#  1 = Enable predictive checks (default)

enable_predictive_host_dependency_checks=1



# ENABLE PREDICTIVE SERVICE DEPENDENCY CHECKS
# This option determines whether or not Nagios will attempt to execute

# service dependency logic works well.
# Values:
#  0 = Disable predictive checks
#  1 = Enable predictive checks (default)

enable_predictive_service_dependency_checks=1



# SOFT STATE DEPENDENCIES
# This option determines whether or not Nagios will use soft state
# information when checking host and service dependencies. Normally
# Nagios will only use the latest hard host or service state when
# checking dependencies. If you want it to use the latest state (regardless
# of whether its a soft or hard state type), enable this option.
# Values:
#  0 = Don't use soft state dependencies (default)
#  1 = Use soft state dependencies

soft_state_dependencies=0



# TIME CHANGE ADJUSTMENT THRESHOLDS
# These options determine when Nagios will react to detected changes
# in system time (either forward or backwards).

#time_change_threshold=900



# AUTO-RESCHEDULING OPTION
# This option determines whether or not Nagios will attempt to
# automatically reschedule active host and service checks to
# "smooth" them out over time.  This can help balance the load on
# the monitoring server.
# WARNING: THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE - IT CAN DEGRADE
# PERFORMANCE, RATHER THAN INCREASE IT, IF USED IMPROPERLY

auto_reschedule_checks=0



# AUTO-RESCHEDULING INTERVAL
# This option determines how often (in seconds) Nagios will

# has an effect if the auto_reschedule_checks option is enabled.
# Default is 30 seconds.
# WARNING: THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE - IT CAN DEGRADE
# PERFORMANCE, RATHER THAN INCREASE IT, IF USED IMPROPERLY

auto_rescheduling_interval=30



# AUTO-RESCHEDULING WINDOW
# This option determines the "window" of time (in seconds) that
# Nagios will look at when automatically rescheduling checks.
# Only host and service checks that occur in the next X seconds
# (determined by this variable) will be rescheduled. This option
# only has an effect if the auto_reschedule_checks option is
# enabled.  Default is 180 seconds (3 minutes).
# WARNING: THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE - IT CAN DEGRADE
# PERFORMANCE, RATHER THAN INCREASE IT, IF USED IMPROPERLY

auto_rescheduling_window=180



# TIMEOUT VALUES
# These options control how much time Nagios will allow various

# RETAIN STATE INFORMATION
# This setting determines whether or not Nagios will save state
# information for services and hosts before it shuts down.  Upon
# startup Nagios will reload all saved service and host state
# information before starting to monitor.  This is useful for
# maintaining long-term data on state statistics, etc, but will
# slow Nagios down a bit when it (re)starts.  Since its only
# a one-time penalty, I think its well worth the additional
# startup delay.

retain_state_information=1



# STATE RETENTION FILE
# This is the file that Nagios should use to store host and
# service state information before it shuts down.  The state
# information in this file is also read immediately prior to
# starting to monitor the network when Nagios is restarted.
# This file is used only if the retain_state_information
# variable is set to 1.

state_retention_file=/usr/local/nagios/var/retention.dat



# RETENTION DATA UPDATE INTERVAL
# This setting determines how often (in minutes) that Nagios
# will automatically save retention data during normal operation.
# If you set this value to 0, Nagios will not save retention
# data at regular interval, but it will still save retention
# data before shutting down or restarting.  If you have disabled
# state retention, this option has no effect.

retention_update_interval=60



# USE RETAINED PROGRAM STATE
# This setting determines whether or not Nagios will set
# program status variables based on the values saved in the
# retention file.  If you want to use retained program status
# information, set this value to 1.  If not, set this value
# to 0.

use_retained_program_state=1



# USE RETAINED SCHEDULING INFO
# This setting determines whether or not Nagios will retain
# the scheduling info (next check time) for hosts and services

# RETAINED ATTRIBUTE MASKS (ADVANCED FEATURE)
# The following variables are used to specify specific host and
# service attributes that should *not* be retained by Nagios during
# program restarts.
#
# The values of the masks are bitwise ANDs of values specified
# by the "MODATTR_" definitions found in include/common.h.
# For example, if you do not want the current enabled/disabled state
# of flap detection and event handlers for hosts to be retained, you
# would use a value of 24 for the host attribute mask...
# MODATTR_EVENT_HANDLER_ENABLED (8) + MODATTR_FLAP_DETECTION_ENABLED (16) = 24

# This mask determines what host attributes are not retained
retained_host_attribute_mask=0

# This mask determines what service attributes are not retained
retained_service_attribute_mask=0

# These two masks determine what process attributes are not retained.
# There are two masks, because some process attributes have host and service
# options.  For example, you can disable active host checks, but leave active
# service checks enabled.
retained_process_host_attribute_mask=0
retained_process_service_attribute_mask=0

# These two masks determine what contact attributes are not retained.
# There are two masks, because some contact attributes have host and
# service options.  For example, you can disable host notifications for
# a contact, but leave service notifications enabled for them.
retained_contact_host_attribute_mask=0
retained_contact_service_attribute_mask=0



# INTERVAL LENGTH
# This is the seconds per unit interval as used in the
# host/contact/service configuration files.  Setting this to 60 means
# that each interval is one minute long (60 seconds).  Other settings
# have not been tested much, so your mileage is likely to vary...

interval_length=60



# CHECK FOR UPDATES
# This option determines whether Nagios will automatically check to
# see if new updates (releases) are available.  It is recommend that you
# enable this option to ensure that you stay on top of the latest critical
# patches to Nagios.  Nagios is critical to you - make sure you keep it in
# good shape.  Nagios will check once a day for new updates. Data collected
# by Nagios Enterprises from the update check is processed in accordance
# with our privacy policy - see https://api.nagios.org for details.

check_for_updates=1



# BARE UPDATE CHECK
# This option determines what data Nagios will send to api.nagios.org when
# it checks for updates.  By default, Nagios will send information on the
# current version of Nagios you have installed, as well as an indicator as
# to whether this was a new installation or not.  Nagios Enterprises uses
# this data to determine the number of users running specific version of
# Nagios.  Enable this option if you do not want this information to be sent.

# This determines whether or not Nagios will obsess over service
# checks and run the ocsp_command defined below.  Unless you're
# planning on implementing distributed monitoring, do not enable
# this option.  Read the HTML docs for more information on
# implementing distributed monitoring.
# Values: 1 = obsess over services, 0 = do not obsess (default)

obsess_over_services=0



# OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE SERVICE PROCESSOR COMMAND
# This is the command that is run for every service check that is
# processed by Nagios.  This command is executed only if the
# obsess_over_services option (above) is set to 1.  The command
# argument is the short name of a command definition that you
# define in your host configuration file. Read the HTML docs for
# more information on implementing distributed monitoring.

#ocsp_command=somecommand



# OBSESS OVER HOST CHECKS OPTION
# This determines whether or not Nagios will obsess over host
# checks and run the ochp_command defined below.  Unless you're
# planning on implementing distributed monitoring, do not enable
# this option.  Read the HTML docs for more information on
# implementing distributed monitoring.
# Values: 1 = obsess over hosts, 0 = do not obsess (default)

obsess_over_hosts=0



# OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE HOST PROCESSOR COMMAND
# This is the command that is run for every host check that is
# processed by Nagios.  This command is executed only if the
# obsess_over_hosts option (above) is set to 1.  The command
# argument is the short name of a command definition that you
# define in your host configuration file. Read the HTML docs for
# more information on implementing distributed monitoring.

#ochp_command=somecommand



# TRANSLATE PASSIVE HOST CHECKS OPTION
# This determines whether or not Nagios will translate
# DOWN/UNREACHABLE passive host check results into their proper
# state for this instance of Nagios.  This option is useful
# if you have distributed or failover monitoring setup.  In
# these cases your other Nagios servers probably have a different
# "view" of the network, with regards to the parent/child relationship
# of hosts.  If a distributed monitoring server thinks a host
# is DOWN, it may actually be UNREACHABLE from the point of
# this Nagios instance.  Enabling this option will tell Nagios
# to translate any DOWN or UNREACHABLE host states it receives
# passively into the correct state from the view of this server.
# Values: 1 = perform translation, 0 = do not translate (default)

translate_passive_host_checks=0



# PASSIVE HOST CHECKS ARE SOFT OPTION
# This determines whether or not Nagios will treat passive host
# checks as being HARD or SOFT.  By default, a passive host check
# result will put a host into a HARD state type.  This can be changed
# by enabling this option.
# Values: 0 = passive checks are HARD, 1 = passive checks are SOFT

passive_host_checks_are_soft=0



# ORPHANED HOST/SERVICE CHECK OPTIONS
# These options determine whether or not Nagios will periodically
# check for orphaned host service checks.  Since service checks are
# not rescheduled until the results of their previous execution
# instance are processed, there exists a possibility that some
# checks may never get rescheduled.  A similar situation exists for
# host checks, although the exact scheduling details differ a bit
# from service checks.  Orphaned checks seem to be a rare
# problem and should not happen under normal circumstances.
# If you have problems with service checks never getting
# rescheduled, make sure you have orphaned service checks enabled.
# Values: 1 = enable checks, 0 = disable checks

check_for_orphaned_services=1
check_for_orphaned_hosts=1



# SERVICE FRESHNESS CHECK OPTION
# This option determines whether or not Nagios will periodically
# check the "freshness" of service results.  Enabling this option
# is useful for ensuring passive checks are received in a timely
# manner.
# Values: 1 = enabled freshness checking, 0 = disable freshness checking

check_service_freshness=1



# SERVICE FRESHNESS CHECK INTERVAL
# This setting determines how often (in seconds) Nagios will
# check the "freshness" of service check results.  If you have
# disabled service freshness checking, this option has no effect.

service_freshness_check_interval=60



# SERVICE CHECK TIMEOUT STATE
# This setting determines the state Nagios will report when a
# service check times out - that is does not respond within
# service_check_timeout seconds.  This can be useful if a
# machine is running at too high a load and you do not want
# to consider a failed service check to be critical (the default).
# Valid settings are:
# c - Critical (default)
# u - Unknown
# w - Warning
# o - OK

service_check_timeout_state=c



# HOST FRESHNESS CHECK OPTION
# This option determines whether or not Nagios will periodically
# check the "freshness" of host results.  Enabling this option
# is useful for ensuring passive checks are received in a timely
# manner.
# Values: 1 = enabled freshness checking, 0 = disable freshness checking

check_host_freshness=0



# HOST FRESHNESS CHECK INTERVAL
# This setting determines how often (in seconds) Nagios will
# check the "freshness" of host check results.  If you have
# disabled host freshness checking, this option has no effect.

host_freshness_check_interval=60




# ADDITIONAL FRESHNESS THRESHOLD LATENCY
# This setting determines the number of seconds that Nagios
# will add to any host and service freshness thresholds that
# it calculates (those not explicitly specified by the user).

additional_freshness_latency=15




# FLAP DETECTION OPTION
# This option determines whether or not Nagios will try
# and detect hosts and services that are "flapping".
# Flapping occurs when a host or service changes between
# states too frequently.  When Nagios detects that a
# host or service is flapping, it will temporarily suppress
# notifications for that host/service until it stops
# flapping.  Flap detection is very experimental, so read
# the HTML documentation before enabling this feature!
# Values: 1 = enable flap detection
#         0 = disable flap detection (default)

enable_flap_detection=1



# FLAP DETECTION THRESHOLDS FOR HOSTS AND SERVICES
# Read the HTML documentation on flap detection for
# an explanation of what this option does.  This option
# has no effect if flap detection is disabled.

low_service_flap_threshold=5.0
high_service_flap_threshold=20.0
low_host_flap_threshold=5.0
high_host_flap_threshold=20.0



# DATE FORMAT OPTION
# This option determines how short dates are displayed. Valid options
# include:
#	us		(MM-DD-YYYY HH:MM:SS)
#	euro    	(DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM:SS)
#	iso8601		(YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
#	strict-iso8601	(YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)
#

date_format=us




# TIMEZONE OFFSET
# This option is used to override the default timezone that this
# instance of Nagios runs in.  If not specified, Nagios will use
# the system configured timezone.
#
# NOTE: In order to display the correct timezone in the CGIs, you
# will also need to alter the Apache directives for the CGI path
# to include your timezone.  Example:
#
#   <Directory "/usr/local/nagios/sbin/">
#      SetEnv TZ "Australia/Brisbane"
#      ...
#   </Directory>

#use_timezone=US/Mountain
#use_timezone=Australia/Brisbane



# ILLEGAL OBJECT NAME CHARACTERS
# This option allows you to specify illegal characters that cannot
# be used in host names, service descriptions, or names of other
# object types.

illegal_object_name_chars=`~!$%^&*|'"<>?,()=



# ILLEGAL MACRO OUTPUT CHARACTERS
# This option allows you to specify illegal characters that are
# stripped from macros before being used in notifications, event
# handlers, etc.  This DOES NOT affect macros used in service or
# host check commands.
# The following macros are stripped of the characters you specify:
#	$HOSTOUTPUT$
#	$LONGHOSTOUTPUT$
#	$HOSTPERFDATA$
#	$HOSTACKAUTHOR$
#	$HOSTACKCOMMENT$
#	$SERVICEOUTPUT$
#	$LONGSERVICEOUTPUT$
#	$SERVICEPERFDATA$
#	$SERVICEACKAUTHOR$
#	$SERVICEACKCOMMENT$

illegal_macro_output_chars=`~$&|'"<>



# REGULAR EXPRESSION MATCHING
# This option controls whether or not regular expression matching
# takes place in the object config files.  Regular expression
# matching is used to match host, hostgroup, service, and service
# group names/descriptions in some fields of various object types.
# Values: 1 = enable regexp matching, 0 = disable regexp matching

use_regexp_matching=0



# "TRUE" REGULAR EXPRESSION MATCHING
# This option controls whether or not "true" regular expression
# matching takes place in the object config files.  This option
# only has an effect if regular expression matching is enabled
# (see above).  If this option is DISABLED, regular expression
# matching only occurs if a string contains wildcard characters
# (* and ?).  If the option is ENABLED, regexp matching occurs
# all the time (which can be annoying).
# Values: 1 = enable true matching, 0 = disable true matching

use_true_regexp_matching=0



# ADMINISTRATOR EMAIL/PAGER ADDRESSES
# The email and pager address of a global administrator (likely you).
# Nagios never uses these values itself, but you can access them by
# using the $ADMINEMAIL$ and $ADMINPAGER$ macros in your notification
# commands.

admin_email=nagios@localhost
admin_pager=pagenagios@localhost



# DAEMON CORE DUMP OPTION
# This option determines whether or not Nagios is allowed to create
# a core dump when it runs as a daemon.  Note that it is generally
# considered bad form to allow this, but it may be useful for
# debugging purposes.  Enabling this option doesn't guarantee that
# a core file will be produced, but that's just life...
# Values: 1 - Allow core dumps
#         0 - Do not allow core dumps (default)

daemon_dumps_core=0



# LARGE INSTALLATION TWEAKS OPTION
# This option determines whether or not Nagios will take some shortcuts
# which can save on memory and CPU usage in large Nagios installations.
# Read the documentation for more information on the benefits/tradeoffs
# of enabling this option.
# Values: 1 - Enabled tweaks
#         0 - Disable tweaks (default)

use_large_installation_tweaks=0



# ENABLE ENVIRONMENT MACROS
# This option determines whether or not Nagios will make all standard
# macros available as environment variables when host/service checks
# and system commands (event handlers, notifications, etc.) are
# executed.
# Enabling this is a very bad idea for anything but very small setups,
# as it means plugins, notification scripts and eventhandlers may run
# out of environment space. It will also cause a significant increase
# in CPU- and memory usage and drastically reduce the number of checks
# you can run.
# Values: 1 - Enable environment variable macros
#         0 - Disable environment variable macros (default)

enable_environment_macros=0



# CHILD PROCESS MEMORY OPTION
# This option determines whether or not Nagios will free memory in
# child processes (processed used to execute system commands and host/
# service checks).  If you specify a value here, it will override
# program defaults.
# Value: 1 - Free memory in child processes
#        0 - Do not free memory in child processes

#free_child_process_memory=1



# CHILD PROCESS FORKING BEHAVIOR
# This option determines how Nagios will fork child processes
# (used to execute system commands and host/service checks).  Normally
# child processes are fork()ed twice, which provides a very high level
# of isolation from problems.  Fork()ing once is probably enough and will
# save a great deal on CPU usage (in large installs), so you might
# want to consider using this.  If you specify a value here, it will
# program defaults.
# Value: 1 - Child processes fork() twice
#        0 - Child processes fork() just once

#child_processes_fork_twice=1



# DEBUG LEVEL
# This option determines how much (if any) debugging information will
# be written to the debug file.  OR values together to log multiple
# types of information.
# Values:
#         -1      = Everything
#          0      = Nothing
#          1      = Functions

# DEBUG VERBOSITY
# This option determines how verbose the debug log out will be.
# Values: 0 = Brief output
#         1 = More detailed
#         2 = Very detailed

debug_verbosity=1



# DEBUG FILE
# This option determines where Nagios should write debugging information.

debug_file=/usr/local/nagios/var/nagios.debug



# MAX DEBUG FILE SIZE
# This option determines the maximum size (in bytes) of the debug file.  If
# the file grows larger than this size, it will be renamed with a .old
# extension.  If a file already exists with a .old extension it will
# automatically be deleted.  This helps ensure your disk space usage doesn't
# get out of control when debugging Nagios.

max_debug_file_size=1000000



# Should we allow hostgroups to have no hosts, we default this to off since
# that was the old behavior

allow_empty_hostgroup_assignment=0



# Normally worker count is dynamically allocated based on 1.5 * number of cpu's
# with a minimum of 4 workers.  This value will override the defaults

#check_workers=3



# DISABLE SERVICE CHECKS WHEN HOST DOWN
# This option will disable all service checks if the host is not in an UP state
#
# While desirable in some environments, enabling this value can distort report
# values as the expected quantity of checks will not have been performed

#host_down_disable_service_checks=0



# SET SERVICE/HOST STATUS WHEN SERVICE CHECK SKIPPED
# These options will allow you to set the status of a service when its
# service check is skipped due to one of three reasons:
# 1) failed dependency check; 2) parent's status; 3) host not up
# Number 3 can only happen if 'host_down_disable_service_checks' above
# is set to 1.
# Valid values for the service* options are:
#     -1     Do not change the service status (default - same as before 4.4)

##############################################################################


# LOG FILE
# This is the main log file where service and host events are logged
# for historical purposes.  This should be the first option specified
# in the config file!!!

log_file=/usr/local/nagios/var/nagios.log



# OBJECT CONFIGURATION FILE(S)
# These are the object configuration files in which you define hosts,
# host groups, contacts, contact groups, services, etc.
# You can split your object definitions across several config files
# if you wish (as shown below), or keep them all in a single config file.

# You can specify individual object config files as shown below:
cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/commands.cfg
cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg
cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/timeperiods.cfg
cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/templates.cfg

# Definitions for monitoring the local (Linux) host
cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/localhost.cfg

# Definitions for monitoring a Windows machine
#cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/windows.cfg

# Definitions for monitoring a router/switch
#cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/switch.cfg

# Definitions for monitoring a network printer
#cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/printer.cfg


# You can also tell Nagios to process all config files (with a .cfg
# extension) in a particular directory by using the cfg_dir
# directive as shown below:

cfg_dir=/usr/local/nagios/etc/servers
#cfg_dir=/usr/local/nagios/etc/printers
#cfg_dir=/usr/local/nagios/etc/switches
#cfg_dir=/usr/local/nagios/etc/routers




# OBJECT CACHE FILE
# This option determines where object definitions are cached when
# Nagios starts/restarts.  The CGIs read object definitions from
# this cache file (rather than looking at the object config files
# directly) in order to prevent inconsistencies that can occur
# when the config files are modified after Nagios starts.

object_cache_file=/usr/local/nagios/var/objects.cache



# PRE-CACHED OBJECT FILE
# This options determines the location of the precached object file.
# If you run Nagios with the -p command line option, it will preprocess
# your object configuration file(s) and write the cached config to this
# file.  You can then start Nagios with the -u option to have it read
# object definitions from this precached file, rather than the standard
# object configuration files (see the cfg_file and cfg_dir options above).
# Using a precached object file can speed up the time needed to (re)start
# the Nagios process if you've got a large and/or complex configuration.
# Read the documentation section on optimizing Nagios to find our more
# about how this feature works.

precached_object_file=/usr/local/nagios/var/objects.precache



# RESOURCE FILE
# This is an optional resource file that contains $USERx$ macro
# definitions. Multiple resource files can be specified by using
# multiple resource_file definitions.  The CGIs will not attempt to
# read the contents of resource files, so information that is
# considered to be sensitive (usernames, passwords, etc) can be
# defined as macros in this file and restrictive permissions (600)
# can be placed on this file.

resource_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/resource.cfg



# STATUS FILE
# This is where the current status of all monitored services and
# hosts is stored.  Its contents are read and processed by the CGIs.
# The contents of the status file are deleted every time Nagios
#  restarts.

status_file=/usr/local/nagios/var/status.dat



# STATUS FILE UPDATE INTERVAL
# This option determines the frequency (in seconds) that
# Nagios will periodically dump program, host, and
# service status data.

status_update_interval=10



# NAGIOS USER
# This determines the effective user that Nagios should run as.
# You can either supply a username or a UID.

nagios_user=nagios



# NAGIOS GROUP
# This determines the effective group that Nagios should run as.
# You can either supply a group name or a GID.

nagios_group=nagios



# EXTERNAL COMMAND OPTION
# This option allows you to specify whether or not Nagios should check
# for external commands (in the command file defined below). 
# By default Nagios will check for external commands.
# If you want to be able to use the CGI command interface
# you will have to enable this.
# Values: 0 = disable commands, 1 = enable commands

check_external_commands=1



# EXTERNAL COMMAND FILE
# This is the file that Nagios checks for external command requests.
# It is also where the command CGI will write commands that are submitted
# by users, so it must be writeable by the user that the web server
# is running as (usually 'nobody').  Permissions should be set at the
# directory level instead of on the file, as the file is deleted every
# time its contents are processed.

command_file=/usr/local/nagios/var/rw/nagios.cmd



# QUERY HANDLER INTERFACE
# This is the socket that is created for the Query Handler interface

#query_socket=/usr/local/nagios/var/rw/nagios.qh



# LOCK FILE
# This is the lockfile that Nagios will use to store its PID number
# in when it is running in daemon mode.

lock_file=/run/nagios.lock



# TEMP FILE
# This is a temporary file that is used as scratch space when Nagios
# updates the status log, cleans the comment file, etc.  This file
# is created, used, and deleted throughout the time that Nagios is
# running.

temp_file=/usr/local/nagios/var/nagios.tmp



# TEMP PATH
# This is path where Nagios can create temp files for service and
# host check results, etc.

temp_path=/tmp



# EVENT BROKER OPTIONS
# Controls what (if any) data gets sent to the event broker.
# Values:  0      = Broker nothing
#         -1      = Broker everything
#         <other> = See documentation

event_broker_options=-1



# EVENT BROKER MODULE(S)
# This directive is used to specify an event broker module that should
# by loaded by Nagios at startup.  Use multiple directives if you want
# to load more than one module.  Arguments that should be passed to
# the module at startup are separated from the module path by a space.
#
#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING !!! WARNING
#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#
# Do NOT overwrite modules while they are being used by Nagios or Nagios
# will crash in a fiery display of SEGFAULT glory.  This is a bug/limitation
# either in dlopen(), the kernel, and/or the filesystem.  And maybe Nagios...
#
# The correct/safe way of updating a module is by using one of these methods:
#    1. Shutdown Nagios, replace the module file, restart Nagios
#    2. Delete the original module file, move the new module file into place,
#	restart Nagios
#
# Example:
#
#   broker_module=<modulepath> [moduleargs]

#broker_module=/somewhere/module1.o
#broker_module=/somewhere/module2.o arg1 arg2=3 debug=0



# LOG ROTATION METHOD
# This is the log rotation method that Nagios should use to rotate
# the main log file. Values are as follows..
#	n	= None - don't rotate the log
#	h	= Hourly rotation (top of the hour)
#	d	= Daily rotation (midnight every day)
#	w	= Weekly rotation (midnight on Saturday evening)
#	m	= Monthly rotation (midnight last day of month)

log_rotation_method=d



# LOG ARCHIVE PATH
# This is the directory where archived (rotated) log files should be
# placed (assuming you've chosen to do log rotation).

log_archive_path=/usr/local/nagios/var/archives



# LOGGING OPTIONS
# If you want messages logged to the syslog facility, as well as the
# Nagios log file set this option to 1.  If not, set it to 0.

use_syslog=1



# NOTIFICATION LOGGING OPTION
# If you don't want notifications to be logged, set this value to 0.
# If notifications should be logged, set the value to 1.

log_notifications=1



# SERVICE RETRY LOGGING OPTION
# If you don't want service check retries to be logged, set this value
# to 0.  If retries should be logged, set the value to 1.

log_service_retries=1



# HOST RETRY LOGGING OPTION
# If you don't want host check retries to be logged, set this value to
# 0.  If retries should be logged, set the value to 1.

log_host_retries=1



# EVENT HANDLER LOGGING OPTION
# If you don't want host and service event handlers to be logged, set
# this value to 0.  If event handlers should be logged, set the value
# to 1.

log_event_handlers=1



# INITIAL STATES LOGGING OPTION
# If you want Nagios to log all initial host and service states to
# the main log file (the first time the service or host is checked)
# you can enable this option by setting this value to 1.  If you
# are not using an external application that does long term state
# statistics reporting, you do not need to enable this option.  In
# this case, set the value to 0.

log_initial_states=0



# CURRENT STATES LOGGING OPTION
# If you don't want Nagios to log all current host and service states
# after log has been rotated to the main log file, you can disable this
# option by setting this value to 0. Default value is 1.

log_current_states=1



# EXTERNAL COMMANDS LOGGING OPTION
# If you don't want Nagios to log external commands, set this value
# to 0.  If external commands should be logged, set this value to 1.
# Note: This option does not include logging of passive service
# checks - see the option below for controlling whether or not
# passive checks are logged.

log_external_commands=1



# PASSIVE CHECKS LOGGING OPTION
# If you don't want Nagios to log passive host and service checks, set
# this value to 0.  If passive checks should be logged, set
# this value to 1.

log_passive_checks=1



# GLOBAL HOST AND SERVICE EVENT HANDLERS
# These options allow you to specify a host and service event handler
# command that is to be run for every host or service state change.
# The global event handler is executed immediately prior to the event
# handler that you have optionally specified in each host or
# service definition. The command argument is the short name of a
# command definition that you define in your host configuration file.
# Read the HTML docs for more information.

#global_host_event_handler=somecommand
#global_service_event_handler=somecommand



# SERVICE INTER-CHECK DELAY METHOD
# This is the method that Nagios should use when initially
# "spreading out" service checks when it starts monitoring.  The
# default is to use smart delay calculation, which will try to
# space all service checks out evenly to minimize CPU load.
# Using the dumb setting will cause all checks to be scheduled
# at the same time (with no delay between them)!  This is not a
# good thing for production, but is useful when testing the
# parallelization functionality.
#	n	= None - don't use any delay between checks
#	d	= Use a "dumb" delay of 1 second between checks
#	s	= Use "smart" inter-check delay calculation
#       x.xx    = Use an inter-check delay of x.xx seconds

service_inter_check_delay_method=s



# MAXIMUM SERVICE CHECK SPREAD
# This variable determines the timeframe (in minutes) from the
# program start time that an initial check of all services should
# be completed.  Default is 30 minutes.

max_service_check_spread=30



# SERVICE CHECK INTERLEAVE FACTOR
# This variable determines how service checks are interleaved.
# Interleaving the service checks allows for a more even
# distribution of service checks and reduced load on remote
# hosts.  Setting this value to 1 is equivalent to how versions

# ENABLE ENVIRONMENT MACROS
# This option determines whether or not Nagios will make all standard
# macros available as environment variables when host/service checks
# and system commands (event handlers, notifications, etc.) are
# executed.
# Enabling this is a very bad idea for anything but very small setups,
# as it means plugins, notification scripts and eventhandlers may run
# out of environment space. It will also cause a significant increase

#free_child_process_memory=1



# CHILD PROCESS FORKING BEHAVIOR
# This option determines how Nagios will fork child processes
# (used to execute system commands and host/service checks).  Normally
# child processes are fork()ed twice, which provides a very high level
# of isolation from problems.  Fork()ing once is probably enough and will
# save a great deal on CPU usage (in large installs), so you might
# want to consider using this.  If you specify a value here, it will

# Valid values for the service* options are:
#     -1     Do not change the service status (default - same as before 4.4)
